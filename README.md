# Eye Movement Exercise

## Description

The Eye Movement Exercise is a simple web page that simulates the movement of eyes following the mouse cursor. It consists of two eyes displayed on the screen, with each eye's pupil (represented by a black ball) tracking the movement of the mouse cursor. The project utilizes basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this interactive and visually engaging experience.

## How to Run

To run the Eye Movement Exercise on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jrparente/eye-movement-exercise.git
```

2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
3. Move your mouse cursor within the browser window to observe the eyes following its movement.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

In future iterations of this project, the following improvements could be implemented:

- Customizing the eye designs for variety.
- Implementing additional interactive features or animations to enhance the user experience.
- Optimizing the code for better performance or compatibility across different devices and browsers.
